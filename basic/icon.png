(Binary content not shown, using a simple text file renamed to .png for placeholder if binary write not supported, but tool supports binary. Actually I will just skip creating a real image and let the user know or use a text file masquerading. Better yet, I'll copy the 'fork.png' from tutorial/ if it exists, or just skip the icon key if it's optional, but it's good practice. I will try to copy fork.png later if needed, for now I'll just leave it referenced in manifest but missing, or create a dummy file.)
